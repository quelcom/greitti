Greitti

Experimenting with the Reittiopas API: http://developer.reittiopas.fi/pages/fi/reittiopas-api.php?lang=FI

Requirements
- node.js 0.4+ (http://nodejs.org/)

Greitti is a proof of concept webpage that fetches routing information from a
user defined departure to a system defined destination and plots the information
on Google Maps.

Since login authentication has to be included in each request (all data is
coming from HTTP GET requests..) there is a nodejs component that hides the
actual request from the client.

Take this as a proof of concept only (and as an excuse to try nodejs).
